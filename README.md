<h3>Known Limitations and points to think about when using:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can use this object once on a sheet, if multiple are used only the first will render.</li>
<li>If you use this chart on multiple sheets with different measures (which you can) the chart settings appear to affect all versions in the application. Both charts work but only one set of color ect setting is possible.</li>
</ul>
